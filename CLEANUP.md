# Codebase Cleanup Log

This document tracks the cleanup and optimization efforts for the SentriX surveillance system.

## Cleanup Date: 2025-10-02

---

## Step 1: Remove Obsolete Code ✅

### Removed Directories

#### `cli-only/` - DELETED
**Reason**: Superseded by modular architecture in `video-feed/videofeed/`

This directory contained a single-file implementation (`feed_cli_single_file.py`) that duplicated functionality now properly organized in the modular package structure:
- All CLI functionality → `videofeed/surveillance.py`
- Credentials management → `videofeed/credentials.py`
- Configuration → `videofeed/config.py`
- Utilities → `videofeed/utils.py`

**Impact**: Removed ~11KB of duplicate code

#### `basic-ui/streamlit_ui.py` - DELETED
**Reason**: Redundant with integrated FastAPI web interface

The Streamlit UI was an early prototype that has been replaced by:
- Integrated FastAPI server in `videofeed/visualizer.py`
- Professional templates in `videofeed/templates/viewer.html` and `recordings.html`
- Better performance and integration with the detection system

**Impact**: Removed ~13KB of obsolete UI code

### Preserved Files

#### `basic-ui/dashboard.html` - KEPT
**Reason**: Provides standalone quick-access dashboard

This file serves as a lightweight, standalone HTML dashboard that:
- Works without running a server
- Useful for quick monitoring
- Can be opened directly in browser
- Complements the main integrated UI

**Added**: `basic-ui/README.md` to document usage

---

## Step 2: Consolidate Test Files ✅

### Test Files Reorganized

**Before**: Test files scattered at repository root
**After**: Organized in `video-feed/tests/` directory

#### Moved Files
- `test_db.py` → `video-feed/tests/test_db.py`
- `test_db_connection.py` → `video-feed/tests/test_db_connection.py`
- `test_recording.py` → `video-feed/tests/test_recording.py`
- `test_storage_location.py` → `video-feed/tests/test_storage_location.py`
- `test_supervision_integration.py` → `video-feed/tests/test_supervision_integration.py`

#### Created Test Infrastructure
- **`tests/__init__.py`** - Test package initialization
- **`tests/conftest.py`** - Shared pytest fixtures (temp_dir, test_db_path, test_recordings_dir, sample_config)
- **`pytest.ini`** - Pytest configuration with markers and settings
- **`tests/README.md`** - Comprehensive test documentation

#### Test Markers Added
Tests can now be categorized and run selectively:
- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Unit tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.db` - Database tests
- `@pytest.mark.recording` - Recording tests
- `@pytest.mark.detection` - Detection tests
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Long-running tests
- `@pytest.mark.requires_mediamtx` - Tests requiring MediaMTX

#### Running Tests
```bash
cd video-feed
pytest                    # Run all tests
pytest -m unit           # Run only unit tests
pytest -m "not slow"     # Skip slow tests
pytest tests/test_db.py  # Run specific test file
```

**Impact**: Improved test organization, easier test discovery, better CI/CD integration

## Step 3: Optimize Dependencies (PENDING)

### Dependencies to Remove
Based on analysis, these packages are unused:
- `streamlit` - UI removed
- `altair` - Streamlit dependency
- `qrcode` - Not used in codebase
- `asyncio` - Built-in to Python 3.7+

### Dependencies to Keep
All other dependencies are actively used:
- `opencv-python-headless` - Video processing
- `ultralytics` - YOLO detection
- `fastapi` / `uvicorn` - Web server
- `supervision` - Detection annotations
- `typer` - CLI framework
- `keyring` - Credential storage
- `pyyaml` - Configuration

---

## Step 4: Refactor Large Files (PENDING)

### Files Exceeding 300 Lines

1. **`surveillance.py` (669 lines)**
   - Extract command handlers to separate modules
   - Create `commands/` subdirectory

2. **`visualizer.py` (722 lines)**
   - Extract API routes to `routes/` module
   - Separate authentication logic

3. **`recorder.py` (628 lines)**
   - Extract database operations to `db/recorder_db.py`
   - Separate storage management logic

4. **`detector.py` (559 lines)**
   - Extract frame processing to helper functions
   - Separate annotator logic

5. **`api.py` (549 lines)**
   - Already well-structured
   - Consider minor query optimization

---

## Step 5: Code Quality Improvements (PENDING)

### Logging Standardization
- Ensure consistent log levels across modules
- Add structured logging for better debugging

### Duplicate Code Removal
- Consolidate credential masking logic (appears in multiple files)
- Centralize path expansion utilities

### Error Handling
- Add try-catch blocks for file operations
- Improve error messages for user clarity

---

## Step 6: Configuration Improvements (PENDING)

### Single Source of Truth
- `surveillance.yml` is already the main config
- Remove hardcoded defaults scattered in code
- Use `constants.py` for system-wide constants

---

## Benefits Achieved (Steps 1 & 2)

### Code Reduction
- Removed ~24KB of duplicate/obsolete code
- Eliminated 2 redundant implementations
- Cleaned up repository root (no scattered test files)

### Organization
- Professional test structure with pytest infrastructure
- Shared fixtures and test markers for categorization
- Clear documentation for all test procedures

### Clarity
- Single, clear entry point: `videofeed.surveillance`
- No confusion between old/new implementations
- Tests are easy to discover and run

### Maintainability
- Fewer files to maintain at root level
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better documentation (5 new documentation files)
- CI/CD ready with proper test markers

---

## Next Steps (Remaining Work)

1. ✅ ~~Consolidate test files~~ - **COMPLETED**
2. **Clean up dependencies** - Remove unused packages from requirements.txt
3. **Refactor large files** - Break down into smaller, focused modules
4. **Improve error handling** - Add comprehensive error messages
5. **Add type hints** - Improve IDE support and catch errors early

### To Continue Cleanup

Run the verification script to check current status:
```bash
./verify_cleanup.sh
```

Then proceed with Step 3 (Dependency Optimization) when ready.

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to user-facing APIs
- Configuration file format unchanged
- All existing functionality preserved
